[h1] Introduction [/h1]
Leshy is a character from the video game Inscryption, another deck building rogue-like that involves creature based combat. This mod introduces the Creature card type which is used by the vast majority of Leshy's cards.

[h1] Main Mechanics [/h1]
[h3] Resources / Costs [/h3]
Creatures don't cost Energy. Instead, they cost Blood, Bones, or nothing.
Blood costs are paid by sacrificing a number of creatures in play. You are provided a Squirrel each turn to help pay for these costs.
You obtain 1 Bone whenever a creature dies.

[h3] Creature Stats [/h3]
Creatures have 2 main stats : Attack and Health.
At the end of each turn, creatures deal damage to a random enemy based on their Attack.
When you take damage, creatures redirect that damage to themselves. If their Health reaches 0, they are sent to the discard pile.

[h3] Creature Tribes [/h3]
There are five different tribes : Avian, Canine, Hooved, Insect, and Reptile. Not all creatures have tribes. If a creature does, it is displayed where the card's type is normally displayed.
Tribes don't do anything on their own and only mean something when interacting with other mechanics.

[h3] Sigils [/h3]
Sigils are special keywords that a creature can have that have unique effects. There are a variety of methods for creatures to obtain more Sigils.

[h3] Mysterious Stones [/h3]
This Event appears on the map and allows you to sacrifice a creature to give its Sigils to another. Both creatures cannot have gained any extra Sigils.

[h3] Totem [/h3]
Your Totem is an effect you build during combat using your Powers. It grants all creatures of a certain tribe a certain Sigil. For example: "Canines gain Airborne."

[h1] Developer's Note [/h1]
Hello everyone! This is the first character mod I'm confident enough in to publish and boy has this been quite the journey. I started working on this early 2022 ish and had gone through several revamps and burnouts. The current version tries to remain true to Inscryption Act 1 and Kaycee's Mod with the base mechanics and events while taking a variety of creative liberties. Speaking of creative liberties, I hope you guys like the Glitched Cards. I love that mechanic.

This mod has a lot of moving parts. Like holy hell, we have a lot going on. There are 29 different Sigils. 29!! And you can combine them in a variety of ways. Point being, there will be bugs. I will be [b]shocked[/b] if me and my playtesters found all the bugs. If you find any, please let me know!

Shoutouts to my friends and playtesters: ZVisionless, Meh Squirrel, and Muffin.
