[h1] Introduction [/h1]
Leshy is a character from Inscryption, another deck building roguelike centered on creature based combat. This mod introduces the Creature card type, which is used by the vast majority of his card pool.

[h1] Main Mechanics [/h1]
[h3] Resources / Costs [/h3]
Instead of costing energy, Creatures cost Blood, Bones, or nothing.
Pay Blood costs by sacrificing creatures equal to that cost. You gain a Squirrel at the start of your turn to help pay it.
You gain 1 Bone whenever a creature dies.

[h3] Creature Stats [/h3]
Creatures have 2 numeric stats : Attack and Health.
At the end of each turn, creatures deal damage equal to their Attack to a random enemy.
Enemies damage creatures in play from right to left. When a creature has 0 remaining Health, it goes to the discard pile. You take the remainder, if any.

[h3] Creature Tribes [/h3]
Most creatures belong to one of five tribes: Avian, Canine, Hooved, Insect, or Reptile. Some creatures are tribeless. The tribe is displayed in the card type section. Tribes synergize with many things.

[h3] Sigils [/h3]
Sigils are special effects that many creatures have. A creature can gain additional Sigils via multiple methods.

[h3] Mysterious Stones [/h3]
This Event appears on the map and allows you to sacrifice a creature to pass its Sigils to another. Only creatures without Sigils gained from prior events can give or receive Sigils this way.

[h3] Totem [/h3]
A Totem gives creatures of a certain tribe a certain Sigil. Totem head and totem base Powers are used to set the tribe and Sigil respectively. When active, it's written as "Canines gain Airborne".

[h1] Developer's Note [/h1]
Hello everyone! This is the first character mod I'm confident enough in to publish and boy has this been quite the journey. I started working on this early 2022 ish and had gone through several revamps and burnouts. The current version tries to remain true to Inscryption Act 1 and Kaycee's Mod with the base mechanics and events while taking creative and mechanical liberties. Speaking of creative liberties, I hope you guys like the Glitched Cards. I love that mechanic.

This mod has a lot of moving parts. Like holy hell, we have a lot going on. There are 29 different Sigils. 29!! And you can combine them in a variety of ways. Point being, there will be bugs. I will be [b]shocked[/b] if me and my playtesters found all the bugs. If you find any, or have balance suggestions of any kind, please let me know!

Shoutouts to my friends and playtesters: ZVisionless, Meh Squirrel, and Muffin.

If you have any specific questions on mechanics or interactions, check out the documentation I threw together.
