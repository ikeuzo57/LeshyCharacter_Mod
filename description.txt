[h1] Introduction [/h1]
Leshy is a character from the video game Inscryption, another deck building rogue-like that involves creature based combat. This mod introduces the Creature card type which is used by the vast majority of Leshy's cards.

[h1] Mechanics [/h1]
[h3] Resources / Costs [/h3]
Creatures don't cost Energy. Instead, they cost Blood, Bones, or nothing.
Blood costs are paid by sacrificing a creature in play. You are provided a Squirrel each turn to help pay for these costs. Certain creatures are Bloodless and cannot pay for Blood costs.
Bones are obtained whenever a creature dies for any reason.

[h3] Creature Stats [/h3]
Creatures have 2 main stats : Attack and Health.
At the end of each turn, creatures deal damage to a random enemy based on their Attack. This Attack is affected by Strength and Weak.
When you take damage, creatures redirect damage to themselves which damages their Health. If their Health reaches 0, they are sent to the discard pile. Damage is dealt to the rightmost creature with overflow damage going to creatures behind it. Health is affected by Dexterity and Frail (not retroactive).

[h3] Creature Tribes [/h3]
There are five different tribes : Avian, Canine, Hooved, Insect, and Reptile. Not all creatures have tribes. If a creature does, it is displayed where the card's type is normally displayed.
Tribes don't do anything on their own and only mean something when interacting with other mechanics.

[h3] Sigils [/h3]
Sigils are special keywords that a creature can have. Each has unique effects and characteristics. One characteristic all Sigils share is that there are ways to transfer Sigils to other creatures. There are 29 different Sigils present in this mod.

[h3] Totem [/h3]
Your Totem is an effect you build during combat using your Powers. It grants all creatures of a certain tribe a certain Sigil. For example: "Canines gain Airborne."

[h1] Events [/h1]
Events have been reworked. Simply put, this mod takes the base game progression system behind the shed and shoots it with a shotgun. Instead of dealing with the Event system, I replaced it with 5 custom and repeatable Events.
In addition to events in the [b] ? [/b] icon, there are a few Events with their own map icon.

[h2] Map Events [/h2]
[h3] Mysterious Stones [/h3]
This Event allows you to sacrifice a creature to give its Sigils to another. Both creatures cannot have gained any extra Sigils.

[h3] Mycologists [/h3]
This Event only appears on specific floors. It allows you combine two of the same creature, adding their stats and Sigils together. A combined creature cannot be combined again.

[h3] Dredging Room [/h3]
This Event only appears on a specific floor. It can provide unique effects at high cost.

[h2] ? Events [/h2]
[h3] Bone Altar [/h3]
This Event allows you to sacrifice a creature to gain a Bone at the start of combat.

[h3] Goobert [/h3]
This Event creates an altered copy of a creature of your choice.

[h3] Pack [/h3]
This Event offers you some potions. If you have no room, you are instead offered a Pack Rat.

[h3] Trapper [/h3]
This Event lets you buy some Pelts. These make your deck worse but can be sold at a shop for profit.

[h3] Woodcarver [/h3]
This Event offers you a choice of Totem bases. These are the Totem pieces with Sigils. Note that this is not the only way to get Totem bases.
